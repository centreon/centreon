Welcome to Centreon AWIE's documentation!
=========================================

The Centreon AWIE module has been designed to help users configure several Centreon Web platforms in a faster and easier way, thanks to its import/export mechanism.

From a properly configured source environment, you can use the AWIE module to export chosen objects towards a target environment. Those objects will be replicated.

Centreon AWIE is based on CLAPI commands but its added value is to allow using Centreon Web UI instead of commands lines.
