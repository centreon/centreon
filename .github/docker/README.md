## :memo: Prerequisites

* docker
* docker compose >= 2

## :rocket: Quick start

Run following command from repository root directory:

```bash
docker compose -f .github/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
```

Centreon web should be accessible at `http://localhost:4000/centreon`

## :toolbox: Custom database image

By default, MariaDB 10.11 is used to store Centreon data (configuration & monitoring).
This can be overridden with the `MYSQL_IMAGE` environment variable using one of the following ways:
* *Preferred*: Export environment variable directly in your terminal (ex: `export MYSQL_IMAGE=bitnami/mysql:8.1`)
* *Alternative*: Add a new line to environment file `.github/docker/.env` with MYSQL_IMAGE value (ex: `MYSQL_IMAGE=bitnami/mysql:8.1`)

> [!WARNING]
> `export` command is not available on windows, You may need to use a tool like `cross-env` or directly configure windows environment variables

## :toolbox: Custom centreon web image

By default, the Centreon web image targets the develop branch and is installed on almalinux 9.
This can be overridden with the `WEB_IMAGE` environment variable using one of the following ways:
* *Preferred*: Export the environment variable directly in your terminal (ex: `export WEB_IMAGE=docker.centreon.com/centreon/centreon-web-alma9:MON-XXX`)
* *Alternative*: Add a new line to the environment file `.github/docker/.env` with WEB_IMAGE value (ex: `docker.centreon.com/centreon/centreon-web-alma9:MON-XXX`)

> [!NOTE]
> To get an image of centreon-web on other operating system, web workflow needs to be run on a pull request which has label `system`<br/>
> Then, following image can be used: `export WEB_IMAGE=docker.centreon.com/centreon/centreon-web-bookworm:MON-XXX`

centreon-web image accepts the following environment variables:
* `CENTREON_DATASET`:
  * `0`: centreon configuration is empty
  * `1` (default value): inject minimal dataset (commands, hosts, services)
* `CENTREON_LANG`: set language to admin user
  * `en_US` (default value)
  * `fr_FR`
  * `de_DE`
  * `es_ES`
  * `pt_BR`
  * `pt_PT`

Usage:

```bash
CENTREON_DATASET=0 CENTREON_LANG=fr_FR docker compose -f .github/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
```

## :gear: Additional services using profiles

Docker compose has a useful feature which is called `profile`.
It allows to run additional services (containers) by specifying profiles which are declared in `docker-compose.yml`.
Currently, the following profiles are available:
* `poller`: register automatically a poller to centreon web image (:danger: EXPERIMENTAL)
* `glpi`: must be used with `centreon-open-tickets` image to link glpi automatically in open-tickets providers
* `vault`: register automatically hashicorp vault and migrate credentials
* `openid`: run a docker image of keycloak
  * centreon configuration is done automatically with auto import enabled
  * login user: **oidc** / **Centreon!2021**
  * :warning: ACLs must be configured manually
  * :warning: if you use WSL, your browser must run from WSL. Otherwise, you will not have access to openid container ip address.
* `saml`: run a docker image of keycloak
  * centreon configuration is done automatically with auto import enabled
  * login user: **saml** / **Centreon!2021**
  * :warning: ACLs must be configured manually
* `openldap`: run a docker image of openldap
  * centreon configuration is done automatically with auto import enabled
  * login user: **centreon-ldap** / **centreon**
  * :warning: ACLs must be configured manually
* `squid-simple`: run a docker image of squid without authentication (centreon configuration must be done manually)
* `squid-basic-auth`: run a docker image of squid with authentication (centreon configuration must be done manually)
* `mediawiki`: run a docker image of mediawiki (centreon configuration must be done manually)

> [!NOTE]
> docker image for `poller` service (`centreon-poller-alma9`) is built on centreon-collect repository<br/>

Multiple profiles can be specified in a single command:

```bash
docker compose --profile poller --profile vault -f .github/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
```

4 containers will be instantiated:
* **centreon-web**: central server with apache, php-fpm, gorgoned, centreon-engine, centreon-broker
* **database**: MariaDB by default
* **centreon-poller**: poller with gorgoned, centreon-engine (with cbmod)
* **hashicorp vault**

> [!NOTE]
> Running containers can be listed with the following command: `docker ps`<br/>
> Container terminal can be launched with the following command: `docker exec -ti <container_id> bash`<br/>
> Container logs can be displayed with the following command: `docker logs <container_id>`


## :hand: Stop services

Services can be stopped with the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f .github/docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

Do not forget to specify profiles if you used it. Otherwise, additional services will not be stopped:

```bash
docker compose --profile poller --profile vault -f .github/docker/docker-compose.yml down
```
