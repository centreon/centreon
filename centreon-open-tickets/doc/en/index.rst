Centreon Open Tickets is a community module developed to create tickets to an 
ITSM platform using API.


Once done provider configuration, the module allows for an operator to create 
tickets for hosts and services in a non-ok state using a dedicated widget.
Indeed, a button associated with each host or service allows you to connect to 
the API and create the ticket while offering the possibility to acknowledge in 
same time the object.


Regarding the widget configuration, it is possible to see the created tickets
by presenting tickets ID and date of creation of these.
