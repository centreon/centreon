Feature: OpenID Connect authentication
    As an admin of Centreon Platform
    I want to be able to use an external authentication provider
    So that Platform users can use existing authentication services to authenticate

    Given an administrator is logged in the platform
    When the administrator activates the auto-import option for OpenID Connect
    Then the users from the 3rd party authentication service with the contact template are imported
