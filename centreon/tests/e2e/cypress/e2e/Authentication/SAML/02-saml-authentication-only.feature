Feature: SAML authentication
    As an admin of Centreon Platform
    I want to be able to make use of an external authentication provider
    So that Platform users can use existing authentication services to authenticate

Background:
    Scenario: SAML Authentication mode 
        Given an administrator is logged on the platform
        When the administrator sets authentication mode to SAML only
        Then only existing users on Centreon must be able to authenticate with only SAML protocol
