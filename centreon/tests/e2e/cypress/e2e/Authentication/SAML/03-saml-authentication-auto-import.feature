Feature: SAML authentication
    As an admin of Centreon Platform
    I want to be able to make use of an external authentication provider
    So that Platform users can use existing authentication services to authenticate
    
Scenario: Import users from 3rd party authentication service upon their first login
    Given an administrator is logged on the platform
    When the administrator activates the auto-import option for SAML
    Then the users from the 3rd party authentication service with the contact template are imported
