Feature: Managing dashboard permissions
  As a Centreon User with dashboard administration rights,
  I need to be able to manage the permissions any current user of a dashboard's sharelist has
  So that these users may get promoted or demoted on the rights they have on the dashboard

Scenario: Promote a viewer user to an editor on a dashboard
  Given a dashboard featuring a dashboard administrator and a dashboard viewer in its share list
  When the dashboard administrator user promotes the viewer user to an editor
  Then the now-editor user can now perform update operations on the dashboard

Scenario: Demote an editor user to a viewer on a dashboard
  Given a dashboard featuring a dashboard administrator and a dashboard editor in its share list
  When the dashboard administrator user demotes the editor user to a viewer
  Then the now-viewer user cannot perform update operations on the dashboard anymore

Scenario: Remove read permissions on a dashboard to a user
  Given a dashboard featuring a dashboard administrator and a viewer in its share list
  When the dashboard administrator user removes the dashboard editor user from the share list
  Then the dashboard is not visible anymore in the non-admin user's dashboards library

Scenario: Revert a user removal in the share list of a dashboard
  Given a dashboard featuring a dashboard administrator and a user who has just been removed from the share list
  When the dashboard administrator user restores the deleted user to the share list and saves
  Then the restored user retains the same rights on the dashboard
