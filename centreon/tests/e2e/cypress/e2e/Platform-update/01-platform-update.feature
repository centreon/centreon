Feature: Update platform from version A to version B of the same MAJOR
  An admin user can update a platform, from a version A to version B
  which is higher than version A, within the same MAJOR.

Scenario Outline: Administrator performs a platform update procedure
  Given a running platform in '<version_from>' version
  When administrator updates packages to current version
  And administrator runs the update procedure
  Then monitoring should be up and running after update procedure is complete to current version
  And legacy services grid page should still work

  When administrator exports Poller configuration
  Then Poller configuration should be fully generated

  Examples:
      | version_from           |
      | first minor            |
      | last stable            |
      | penultimate stable     |
      | antepenultimate stable |
