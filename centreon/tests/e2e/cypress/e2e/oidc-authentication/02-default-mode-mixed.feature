Feature: OpenID Connect authentication
    As an admin of Centreon Platform
    I want to be able to make use of an external authentication provider
    So that Platform users can use existing authentication services to authenticate
    
Scenario: Default authentication mode Mixed
    Given an administrator logged in the platform
    When the administrator first configures the authentication mode
    Then default authentication mode must be Mixed and users created locally to centreon platform must be able to authenticate
