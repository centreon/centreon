Feature: ContactGroupConfiguration
  As a Centreon admin
  I want to manipulate a contact group
  To see if all simples manipulations work

  Background:
    Given an admin user is logged in a Centreon server
    And a contact group is configured

  @TEST_MON-151337
  Scenario: Edit the properties of a contact group
    When the user updates the properties of the configured contact group
    Then the properties are updated

  @TEST_MON-151338
  Scenario: Duplicate one existing contact group
    When the user duplicates the configured contact group
    Then a new contact group is created with identical properties

  @TEST_MON-151339
  Scenario: Delete one existing contact group
    When the user deletes the configured contact group
    Then the deleted contact group is not visible anymore on the contact group page
