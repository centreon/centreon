    When the user defines a name for the rule
    And the user selects a '<resource_type>' with associated events on which to notify
    And the user selects the '<contact_settings>'
    And the user defines a mail subject
    And the user defines a mail body
    And the user clicks on the "Save" button to confirm

    When changes occur in the configured statuses for the selected '<resource_type>'
    And the hard state has been reached
    And the notification refresh_delay has been reached
    Then an email is sent to the configured '<contact_settings>' with the configured format
    Examples:
      | contact_settings                            | resource_type                           |
      | a single contact                            | host group                              |
