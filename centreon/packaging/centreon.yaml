description: |
  UI to export/import centreon configuration.
  Centreon is a network, system, applicative supervision and monitoring tool,
  it is based upon the most effective Open Source monitoring engine : Nagios.
  Centreon provides a new frontend and new functionnalities to Nagios.
  It allows you to be more efficient in your network monitoring, but also allows
  you to make your supervision information readable by a largest range of users.
  Indeed, a non technical user can now use the Centreon/Nagios couple to easily
  understand your network infrastructure thanks to charts and graphical representations
  of the gathered information. Skilled users still have access to specific and technical
  information collected  by Nagios though.
